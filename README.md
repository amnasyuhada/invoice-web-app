## Introduction

For today's fast-paced business environment, freelancers, small businesses, and service providers require efficient instruments for managing billing and payment processes. To this end, we recommend designing a Simple Invoice System, a built-in web-based application that can simplify the creation, sending, and following of invoices.

The system will provide users with fundamental invoicing features through a simplified interface. Users will be able to securely log in or sign up, manage their clients, create and edit invoices, and track the payment status. Compared to more advanced platforms, this app is confined to the basics of invoicing and is ideal for users who need a basic but reliable billing facility.

This project borrows ideas from open-source options like Invoice Ninja but limit the scope to keep things simple, easy to use, and efficient. The proposed system will serve as a working solution for individuals and small organizations that want to improve the accuracy of billing and save their time.

##  Objectives

The main objectives of this web application is to:

- ‚úÖ **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Provide an intuitive platform for managing invoices and payments made by clients.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Efficiency through Automation**  
  Increase efficiency by automating billing tasks and minimizing the risk of manual errors.

- üßæ **Empower Small Organizations**  
  Equip small businesses with tools to effectively create, track, and manage invoices.

- üìö **Centralized Records**  
  Centralize customer and payment records in one place for easy tracking and reporting.

- üå± **Sustainable Invoicing**  
  Promote sustainability by reducing paper usage through digital invoicing solutions.

## ERD Diagram
![webapp drawio (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cca9d2bf-b5ff-429d-99b0-7fc984f9a06f)


This ERD represents the data structure of a Simple Invoice System designed for freelancers and small businesses. The system includes six main entities: User, Client, Invoice, InvoiceItem, Payment, and RecurringInvoice. Each user can manage multiple clients and generate invoices for them. Invoices can have multiple items and receive multiple payments. Recurring invoices allow users to automate billing on a schedule. The relationships are primarily one-to-many, ensuring a clear and efficient data model.

## 3. User Profile : 
The User Profile Page serves as a centralized interface where authenticated users can view and manage their personal information such as name, email, and profile photo. It enables users to update their details, change their password, and optionally upload a profile picture or adjust personal preferences. This page plays a crucial role in providing self-service account management, making it especially valuable in applications that involve user accounts, team memberships, or administrative roles.

## 4. Dashboard : 
Provides summarized view of invoice management. It includes total revenue, invoices sent, 
pending invoices and overdue invoices. This page also displays the payment trends line graph 
and several tables showing recent invoices, recent payment and recurring invoices.

## 5. Customer :
Customer page of the Invoice Sensei system, displaying a searchable and sortable table of customer records. Key details such as customer name, email, balance, amount paid, last login, date created, date created, updated and deleted are listed.

## 6.1 Invoice :
The system provides comprehensive features for managing both items and invoices. In the **Invoice page**, users can create and edit invoices by selecting customers, adding items, and adjusting quantities. The page offers sorting options for invoice details, such as the status, date, invoice number, and timestamps for creation and updates. This allows users to easily track and manage invoice history. In the **Item management page**, users can create new items by adding product details like name, description, price, and weight. It also includes the option to upload product images and attach files. Users can review the item list and sort it by product name or other information, making it easy to navigate and find specific products. These features, combined with sorting and review options, help streamline the management of inventory and invoices.

## 6.2 Recurring Invoice :
The RecurringInvoice feature automates the generation of invoices on a regular schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly). Instead of manually creating the same invoice repeatedly, users can set up a template that auto-generates invoices at set intervals. More importantly highlights the status such as sent, refund, overdue, or pending. Customer also can check their total amount referring to their frequency and limit.

## 7. Payment:
The payment page allows users to record new customer payments by entering details such as the date, payment number, amount, payment method, and notes. It ensures accurate tracking of transactions for each customer in the system.
